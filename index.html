  <section class="about">
    <h2>🔥 The Expert's Story: Why You Need Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Alex Shah, and I help real estate professionals stop losing leads to silence and start igniting conversions. For years, I specialized in high-stakes B2C sales—where trust is earned over months. I realized the universal flaw in every campaign: the follow-up was always generic, robotic, and killed the momentum. That’s why I specialize in real estate only, and why email is my absolute superpower.</p>
    <p>Real estate is a high-stakes, emotional journey, and the agents who win are the ones who guide, not just sell. My unique experience translates that human psychology—the fear and desire tied to homeownership—into a sequence that sounds like a trusted, patient fiduciary. My campaigns don't just get opened; they start powerful conversations and ensure you are the only agent they trust when they are ready to transact. Ready to automate your authority and watch your pipeline explode?</p>
